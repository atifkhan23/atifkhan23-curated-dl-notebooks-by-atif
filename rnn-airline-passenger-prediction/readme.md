# RNN Airline Passenger Prediction

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to forecast future airline passenger counts based on historical data. The model is trained on the classic [Airline Passengers Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/airline-passengers.csv) which contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.
