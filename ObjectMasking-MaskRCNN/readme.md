# 🧠 InstanceSeg-MaskRCNN

A robust implementation of **instance segmentation** using the **Mask R-CNN** architecture, pretrained on the **COCO dataset**. This project demonstrates how to load a dataset, apply instance segmentation, and visualize the results using Python and TensorFlow.

## 📌 What is Instance Segmentation?

Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that combines:
- **Object Detection** (what and where the objects are)
- **Semantic Segmentation** (what category each pixel belongs to)

🆚 **Difference from Semantic Segmentation:**
- Semantic Segmentation: All objects of a class are labeled the same.
- Instance Segmentation: Each object instance has a separate mask.
