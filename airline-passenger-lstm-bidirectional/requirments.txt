# ✈️ Airline Passenger Forecasting with LSTM & Bidirectional LSTM

This project uses deep learning models (LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM) to forecast monthly airline passenger numbers. It compares the performance of a standard stacked LSTM model and a Bidirectional LSTM on the classic time-series dataset of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.
