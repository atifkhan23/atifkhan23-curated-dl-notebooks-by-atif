# SmartPredictor: Binary Classification with Keras

This project builds a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow for binary classification tasks. The model is trained with dense layers and achieves strong validation accuracy (~75%).

## 📊 Features

- Deep learning model for binary classification
- Tracks training and validation metrics
- Uses `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`
- Outputs training performance summary

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Input Layer: Based on feature count
- Hidden Layers: Dense layers with activation functions (ReLU)
- Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary output
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
